  <h2>Turkey: A Century of Demographic and Economic Change (1927–2024)</h2>
  <p>The chart above illustrates the parallel trends of population growth and economic development in Turkey since the foundation of the Republic in 1927. The blue line, corresponding to the left axis, shows the population, which has experienced continuous and dramatic growth, soaring from approximately 13.5 million in 1927 to around 85 million by 2024—a six-fold increase over the period.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the red line depicts Income per Capita (in USD), which underwent a long period of stagnation before a dramatic acceleration. Income per capita remained relatively flat until the 1970s but then entered a rapid growth phase, spiking sharply after 2000. It reached its historical peak of approximately $10,500 around 2011. However, the last decade has been marked by significant volatility, with a sharp decline followed by a recent rebound, illustrating the complex economic challenges and shifts experienced by the country in the modern era.</p>
